You are tasked with creating a TPS for CSUF students to purchase Spring Concert Tickets for 2019. The initial screen should have options for the user to “Purchase Confirmation” and “Purchase Tickets”. 
For Purchase Ticket:
The user is prompted to enter the package of tickets they want to purchase (one or two-day tickets), as well as the amount of tickets that they wish to purchase. The minimum amount of tickets that can be purchased is 1, and the maximum is 5 tickets, with a 15% discount for a purchase of 3 or more tickets. If more than one ticket is purchased, the program will ask for the First nad Last Name of the ticket user ( who will be using the ticket) and loop back to ask for the name for each ticket purchased.(ie. if they purchase 3 tickets, the program will ask for name information 3 times.  Once the user has selected the ticket type and amount, they will be prompted for payment (can we just use dummy amounts for this so that nothing need be inputted, or do we have to make it valid information. In that case it would be First Name, Last Name, Card Number, Billing Address, Exp. Date). The credit card information will be entered into a file that saves the information inputted. Afterwards the method of pickup is selected by the user, which they can select between pick up at ASI office, or shipping, in which case they will be asked to input their shipping information, this information will be placed in an array for shipping information. After the transaction is complete they will be presented with a unique confirmation number. Once the information is processed the information in the array is saved.

For Purchase Confirmation:
The user will be asked to enter their confirmation number, which, if input correctly, displays the shipping information they entered as well as the ticket purchase information which is pulled from the array. (Amt. of tickets and type of tickets.)
