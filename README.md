If a customer buys 3 tickets they recieve a discount of 10%. Prompt the user to select they type of ticket (1 day or 2 day tickets) and then the quantity they wanted to purchase. Prompt user for information ( name, address, phone, email) and then whether they want to have the ticket shipped or pick up at will call(TSU).
